        "    \n",
        "    _In Python, functions are independent blocks of code, while methods are associated with classes or objects. Functions can be called from anywhere, while methods require an object or class instance to be invoked.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python\n",
        "    \n",
        "    _In Python, \"function arguments\" are the actual values passed to a function when it is called, while \"parameters\" are the variable names listed inside the function definition that act as placeholders to receive those values; essentially, arguments are the \"inputs\" provided to a function, and parameters are the names used to access those inputs within the function body.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    _define a function using the keyword \"def\" followed by the function name, parentheses containing any parameters, and a colon; to call a function, simply write the function name followed by parentheses, including any necessary arguments within them.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "    _In a Python function, the return statement is used to send a specific value back to the code that called the function, essentially marking the end of the function's execution and providing the calculated result or output from the function to be used further in the program; without a return statement, a function would not provide any output value.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "    _An Iterable is basically an object that any user can iterate over. An Iterator is also an object that helps a user in iterating over another object (that is iterable). We can generate an iterator when we pass the object to the iter() method.\n",

        "\n",
        "    _A function that produces a sequence of values on demand, rather than computing and storing all the values at once. Generators are defined using the yield statement, which is used instead of the return statement in a normal function.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "    _he primary advantage of using generators over regular functions is their ability to generate values \"on-demand\" through the yield keyword, leading to significant memory efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences, as they only calculate values when needed (lazy evaluation) instead of storing the entire sequence in memory at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "    _A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function, meaning it's defined without a name, and is typically used when you need to create a simple, one-time use function to pass as an argument to another function, particularly with built-in functions like map, filter, or when you want to write concise code with a single expression evaluation within the function body; essentially, a \"throw-away\" function for a specific task."
